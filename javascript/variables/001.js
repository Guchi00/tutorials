console.log("hello variables");

// Variables are containers for data
// Variables are declared using var (OLD way), let and const
// Variables are declared (and assigned to) before they are used

// With let you can declare a variable then assign a value to it afterwards
let today;
today = 'Tuesday';

let name = 'Max';

// With const you must assign the variable a value at declaration
const weight = 57;
const myBoolean = true;

// Data types: refer to dataTypes.js

// Assignment

// Create 4 variables of each data type using a mix of let and const (2 each)
// use descriptive names for each variable
// For objects, use different data types as values
// For arrays, use different data types as elements

// Good luck!
